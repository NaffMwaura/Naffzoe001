---

## **Task Description**
This project creates an FAQ component where users can interact with questions to show or hide their corresponding answers. It follows a pure HTML/CSS approach without JavaScript.

### . Requirements:
- **Core Functionality**:
  - Clicking a question reveals its answer.
  - If another question is clicked, the previously revealed answer hides (accordion behavior).
- **Responsive Design**:
  - On mobile devices, the questions and answers stack vertically for a clean layout.
  - On larger screens (like tablets or desktops), the layout adjusts for better use of screen space.
## **Files**

- **`basic_FaQ_with_html_css.html`**: Contains the structure of the FAQ accordion.

### **Core Features**
1. **Accordion Behavior**:
   - Each question is implemented as a `<button>` element, making it accessible and interactive.
   - The corresponding answer is wrapped in a `<div>` that toggles visibility using CSS.

2. **Responsive Design**:
   - CSS **media queries** adjust the layout for different screen sizes:
     - On smaller screens (mobile), the questions and answers are stacked vertically.
     - On larger screens (tablets or desktops), the layout adjusts to display a compact view.
